        <p>Thank you much for visiting my webiste!  My name is Ben Reilly and I am a
        software engineer specializing in full-stack development of cool web apps.</p>
        <p>I have many interests, but I at the moment I enjoy making things with and learning about
        human computer interaction, experimental user interfaces, all the myriad uses of machine learning,
      but especailly natural langauge processing, and generative art.  These are subjects where one doesn't
        need to go to deep to experience the magical, uncanny, and deeply weird phenomena of computers and the internet.
      </p>
      <p>I like to think about the internet, even the seemingly cold, mechanical, and commercial parts of it as a
      massive communal artistic project of which we are all a part.  It's kind of like a city, in that any scene within it becomes
      a work of art as soon as you snap a photo.  I think code is a tool but it is also a material, we use it to make
      other things but it also embodies the thing as we make it, and once it has a body it can also have a life, or something like one.</p>
