        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi! Thank you for visiting!  My name is Ben Reilly and I am a
        software engineer and/or full-stack web developer.
        </p>
        <p>I have many interests, but at the moment I enjoy making things with, and learning about
        human computer interaction, experimental user interfaces, machine learning
        (especailly natural langauge processing), and generative art.  These are subjects where one doesn't
        need to go too deep to experience the magical, uncanny, and deeply weird phenomena of computers and the internet.
        </p>
        <p>I like to think of the internet, even the seemingly cold, mechanical, or commercial parts of it, as a
        massive communal artistic project we are all doing together.  It's kind of like a city; any scene within it becomes
        a work of art as soon as you snap a photo.  I think code is a tool but it is also a material, a medium in it's own right.
        The things we make are not just inert objects, they are alive! Sort of ;)
